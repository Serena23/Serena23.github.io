De Lucchi has designed furniture for the most known Italian and European companies. \r\nFor Olivetti he has been Director of Design from 1992 to 2002 and he developed experimental projects for Compaq Computers, Philips, Siemens and Vitra. \r\n \r\nHe designed and restored buildings in Japan, Germany, Switzerland and in Italy for Enel, Olivetti, Piaggio, Poste Italiane, Telecom Italia. \r\nIn 1999 he was appointed to renovate some of ENEL's (Italys principal Electricity Company) power plants. For Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bundesbahn, Enel, Poste Italine, Telecom Italia, Hera, Intesa Sanpaolo and other Italian and foreign banks he has redesigned the service environments and corporate image, introducing technical and aesthetic innovation into organization of their working environments. \r\nHe designed buildings for museums including the Triennale di Milano, Palazzo delle Esposizioni di Roma, Neues Museum Berlin and the le Gallerie d'Italia Piazza Scala in Milan. In the last years he developed many architectural projects for private and public client in Georgia, that include the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the bridge of Peace in Tbilisi, the Radison Hotel and Public Service Building in Batumi. \r\n \r\nHis professional work has always gone side-by-side with a personal exploration of architecture, design, technology and crafts. \r\nIn 1990 he founded Produzione Privata, a small-scale production and retail company through which Michele De Lucchi designed products that are made using dedicated artisans and craft techniques. From 2004 he has been using a chain saw to sculpt small wooden houses which create the essentiality of his architectural style. In 2003 the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris has acquired a considerable number of his works. Selections of his products are exhibited in the most important design Museums in Europe, United States and Japan.\r\n\r\n###My project\r\nFor my final project I have chosen the following works by the architect Michele De Lucchi:\r\n\r\n* Murano glass vases from the private collection\r\n* Estense Cabinet library\r\n* Firstchair\r\n* Flamingo table\r\n* Kristall table\r\n* Polar coffee table\r\n* Gloria lamp\r\n\r\nI realized my project in two versions using two different programming languages​​: \r\n\r\n* Javascript --> Plasm.js \r\n* Python --> pyplasm.\r\n\r\n####Murano glass vases\r\nPrivate collection of vases for flowers made ​​of Murano glass and limited edition products.\r\n\r\n#####Realization\r\nThe realization of this work is based mainly on two funcions:\r\n\r\n* **SURFACE**: this funtion draw a surface using ROTATIONAL_SURFACE that is a function of the language Plasm.js\r\n    \r\n        var SURFACE = function (p){\r\n\t    var points = p;\r\n\t    var rot_domain = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,2*PI]])([40,40]);\r\n\t    var c = BEZIER(S0)(points);\r\n\t\tvar surface = MAP(ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c))(rot_domain);\r\n\t\treturn surface;\r\n\t\t}; \t\r\n\tThe parameter p represent an array of points that describe the Bezier curve which will be rotated to create the surface of interest.\r\n* **CYLINDER**: this funtion draw a cylinder using BEZIER CURVES and ROTATIONAL_SURFACE\r\n\r\n\t\tfunction CYLINDER(r,h){\r\n\t\tvar rot_domain = DOMAIN([[0,1],[0,2*PI]])([40,40]);\r\n\t\tvar p1 = [[0,0,0],[r,0,0]];\r\n\t\tvar p2 = [[r,0,0],[r,0,h]];\r\n\t\tvar p3 = [[r,0,h],[0,0,h]];\r\n\t\tvar c1 = BEZIER(S0)(p1);\r\n\t\tvar c2 = BEZIER(S0)(p2);\r\n\t\tvar c3 = BEZIER(S0)(p3);\r\n\t\tvar s1 = MAP(ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c1))(rot_domain);\r\n\t\tvar s2 = MAP(ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c2))(rot_domain);\r\n\t\tvar s3 = MAP(ROTATIONAL_SURFACE(c3))(rot_domain);\r\n\t\tvar cylinder = STRUCT([s1,s2,s3]);\r\n\t\treturn cylinder;\r\n\t\t};\r\n\tThe parameter r represent radius of the base circle of the cylinder, the parameter h represent the height of the cylinder. Is first created the profile of the cylinder with BEZIER function and then rotated with ROTATIONAL_SURFACE function.\r\n\r\n#####Photos and Screenshots\r\n![photo](http://i41.tinypic.com/2upe2vl.jpg)\r\n![screenshot1](http://i39.tinypic.com/audz77.png)\r\n![screenshot2](http://i40.tinypic.com/hvtfv5.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
